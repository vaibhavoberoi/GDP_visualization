# GDP_visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the help of various visualizations of GDP datasets for all states of India, over the period 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16. 
Visualizations also depict the contribution of each of the occupation sectors in the GDP/Tax for each state.
The GDP has also been compared to Education Drop out rates.

Datasets: 
All the data is publicly available and has been sourced from data.gov.in
Here we have divided the datasets into two categories:
•	Data I-A: This dataset contains the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.
•	Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry), and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies, having a separate dataset for each of the states.
